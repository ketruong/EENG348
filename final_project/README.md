## Introduction

Snake is a classic arcade game in which a player maneuvers his or her "snake" around some rectangular area, collecting food and avoiding collisions between the snake’s head and any part of the snake’s body. The snake advances at a constant rate, although the length of the snake’s body increases as it consumes food. New instances of food appear as it is consumed such that there is always exactly one piece of food present on the playing area. Typically, a single player controls a single snake, and the goal is to maximize food consumption. We propose implementing a two-player version of snake on the Arduino. Food
